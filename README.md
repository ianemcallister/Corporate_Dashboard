# Project 4: Corporate Dashboard

This is the fourth project as part of the Udacity Senior Web Developer Nano Degree.

TODO: what is this

**Component Design:** The focus of this project is to incorporate component design.

## Features
**Basic Features**

1. **Responsiveness**
	App is equally functional on mobile and desktop, using responsive design to ensure its displayed in a useable state.

2. **Component Design**
	Application makes use of a Front-End Framework (e.g. `Backbone`, `Angular`, `Ember`, et cetera) and properly separates data from the user interface.

3. **Data Formats**
	Each dashboard uses external data files (data not stored directly within the application). At least one file must be a `comma-separated value` (`.csv`) and at least one must be `.json`.

4. **Near Real-Time Updates**
	Dashboard components must query the datafiles regularly, or receive “push” updates, and update their displays in “near” real-time without requiring a refresh of the application.
